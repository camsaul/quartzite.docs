## What version of Quartzite does this guide cover?

This guide covers Quartzite `2.0.x` (including beta releases).


## Overview

Quartz scheduler is a specialized database that stores jobs and
triggers and executes the jobs according to trigger schedules. It may
store its state in a durable data store (like relational databases
accessible via JDBC or
[MongoDB](https://github.com/michaelklishin/quartz-mongodb)).

Quartz schedulers are also *event emitters*. It is possible to
register listeners for various events (such as scheduler being paused
or a trigger firing).  Schedulers can be extended in using 3rd party
plugins.

Quartzite assumes that most application only ever use a single
scheduler.


## Quartz scheduler lifecycle

Scheduler may be in one of the following states:

 * Not started
 * Started
 * In the standby mode (paused)
 * Shut down

These is not technically an exhaustive list but it gives you a good idea.

Before jobs can be submitted for execution, the scheduler has to be
initialized with the `clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler/initialize`
function:

``` clojure
(ns my.service
  (:require [clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler :as qs]))

(defn -main
  [& m]
  (let [s (qs/initialize)]
    ))
```

This function starts a an instance of Quartz scheduler that maintains
a thread pool of non-daemon threads. Using this function in the
top-level namespace code is a **bad idea**: it will cause Leiningen
tasks like `lein jar` to hang forever because Quartz threads will
prevent JVM from exiting.

When Quartzite scheduler is initialized, it does not trigger jobs
until it is started using
`clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler/start`. Very often this will happen
on application start up:

``` clojure
(ns my.service
  (:require [clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler :as qs]))

(defn -main
  [& m]
  (let [s (-> (qs/initialize) qs/start)]
    ))
```

To put scheduler into standby mode, use `clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler/standby` function:

``` clojure
(ns quartzite.docs.examples
  (:require [clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler :as qs]))

(defn -main
  [& args]
  (let [s (-> (qs/initialize) qs/start)]
    (println "Putting the scheduler in the standby mode...")
    (qs/standby s)))
```

When in the standby mode, scheduler is not active: triggers do not fire and as a consequence, no jobs are executed.

To shut down the scheduler, use `clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler/shutdown`:

``` clojure
(ns quartzite.docs.examples
  (:require [clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler :as qs]))

(defn -main
  [& args]
  (let [s (-> (qs/initialize) qs/start)]
    (println "Shutting the scheduler down...")
    (qs/shutdown s)))
```


Quartzite provides several predicate functions that let you determine current state of the scheduler:

``` clojure
(ns quartzite.docs.examples
  (:require [clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler :as qs]))

(defn -main
  [& args]
  (let [s (-> (qs/initialize) qs/start)]
    (when (qs/started? s)
      (println "The scheduler is running."))
    (qs/standby s)
    (when (qs/standby?s )
      (println "The scheduler is no longer running."))
    (qs/shutdown s)
    (when (qs/shutdown? s)
      (println "The scheduler is shut down."))))
```


## Quartz scheduler configuration

Quartzite relies on Quartz to handle configuration. Quartz uses a property file, `quartz.properties`, that needs to be on the classpath.
With [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org), you specify resource (non-code) file location using the `:resource-paths` key in `project.clj`:

``` clojure
:resource-paths     ["src/resources"]

;; alternative location for dev and test environments:
:profiles     {:dev {:resource-paths ["test/resources"]}}
```

Here is a minimalistic example of `quartz.properties`:

```
org.quartz.scheduler.instanceName = MyappScheduler
org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = 4
```

A more involved example may use a custom durable store and one or more plugins:

``` clojure
org.quartz.scheduler.instanceName = MyappScheduler
org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = 4

## Use a custom persistent scheduler store
#
org.quartz.jobStore.class=mycompany.myservice.quartz.JobStore
org.quartz.jobStore.addresses=10.2.21.102
org.quartz.jobStore.dbName=myservice_production
org.quartz.jobStore.collectionPrefix=quartz

## Quartz plugins
#
org.quartz.plugin.triggHistory.class = org.quartz.plugins.history.LoggingTriggerHistoryPlugin
org.quartz.plugin.jobHistory.class = org.quartz.plugins.history.LoggingJobHistoryPlugin
```

 * [Defining triggers and schedules](/articles/triggers.html)
 * [Using durable stores for scheduler state](/articles/durable_quartz_stores.html)
 * [Using Quartz plugins](/articles/quartz_plugins.html)
